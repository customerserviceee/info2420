<h2>Trader Joes - Critique Page</h2>
<h4><a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/home">www.traderjoes.com</a></h4>
<ol>
	<li>First impression is that it's clean and simple for a grocery store webpage</li>
	
	<li>It has five links for each category and they open on a new tab once you click on one of them</li>
	
	<li>It makes sense to have links and they take you to the page you clicked on and shows that they sell</li>
	
	<li>It shows images of their products and descriptions of the product and it is very simple to look it and being modern</li>
	
	<li>The homepage loaded instantly and the layout was simple and not a heavy page</li>
	
	<li>The webpage was readable although i have a dark mode extension on but it was readable and very user friendly the images were used and it was readable in a dark mode enviroment</li>
	
	<li>It has a navigation where you can go to that page you want to go and it takes you there, if you click the trader joes logo and it'll take you back to the homepage</li>
	
	<li>Theres barely any color scheme, just red and black and some of bit of blue but its just a simple page and doesn't look bad</li>
	
	<li>Yes it does, and its size is normal instead of zooming in to read</li>
	
	<li>The site was well done and the navigation tab is that helps it show where you wanna go to and offers clean page and show a flyer</li>
